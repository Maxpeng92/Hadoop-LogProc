<a id="logproc" class="anchor" href="#logproc" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LogProc</h1>

<p>In this project, I implemented different distributed join algorithms which are described in: </p>

<p><strong>"A Comparison of Join Algorithms for Log Processing in MapReduce"</strong> of <em>Spyros Blanas, Jignesh M. Patel, Vuk Ercegovac, Jun Rao, Eugene J. Shekita and Yuanyuan Tian</em></p>

<p>You can find the paper online at <a href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/%7Etsotras/cs260/F12/LogProc.pdf">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~tsotras/cs260/F12/LogProc.pdf</a>, or in <a href="/material">material</a> directory of this project.</p>

<p><strong>Abbreviations</strong>: L is log table and R is reference table</p>

<h1>
<a id="standard-repartition-join" class="anchor" href="#standard-repartition-join" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Standard Repartition Join</h1>

<p>It is also the join algorithm provided in the contributed join package of Hadoop <strong>(org.apache.hadoop.contrib. utils.join)</strong>. L and R are dynamically partitioned on the join key and the corresponding pairs of partitions are joined. </p>

<pre><code>Map phase: 
    - Each map task works on a split of either R or L, uses tagging to identify with is original table
    - Input: (K: null, V : a record from a split of either R or L)
    - Output: (join key, tagged record)

Reduce phase:
    - Input: (K': join key, LIST V': records from R and L with join key K')
    - Buffer records from R (Br) and buffer records from L (Bl)
    - Performs a cross-product between records in set of Br and Bl.
    - Output: (null, r*l) which r*l is joined record
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Potential problem:</strong> When the key cardinality is small or when the data is highly skewed, all the records for a given join key may not fit in memory (Br + Bl, mostly Bl), R and L are moved across the network.</p>

<h1>
<a id="improved-repartition-join" class="anchor" href="#improved-repartition-join" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Improved Repartition Join</h1>

<p>To fix the buffering problem of the standard repartition join which is Bl too large.</p>

<pre><code>Map phase: 
    - Each map task works on a split of either R or L, uses tagging to identify with is original table
    - Input: (K: null, V : a record from a split of either R or L)
    - Output: (composite_key, tagged record) with composite_key = (join key, tag)

Partition phase: 
    - Input: composite_key K
    - Output: partition of K which is hashcode(K.join_key) % num of reducers

Grouping phase: 
    - Input: composite_key K1 and K2
    - Output: group K1 and K2 if (K1.join_key == K2.join_key)

Secondary sort phase:
    - Input: composite_key K1 and K2
    - Output: K1 &lt; K2 (if K1.tag == ref &amp;&amp; K2.tag == log)

Reduce phase:
    - Input: K′: a composite key with the join key and the tag, LIST V': records for K', first from R, then L
    - Buffer records from R (Br) - **only R**
    - Performs a cross-product between records in set of R and L.
    - Output: (null, r*l) with r*l is joined record
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Potential problem:</strong> Both versions (Standard Repartition Join and Improved Repartition Join) include two major sources of overhead that can hurt performance. In particular, both L and R have to be sorted and sent over the network during the shuffle phase of MapReduce.</p>

<h1>
<a id="directed-join" class="anchor" href="#directed-join" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Directed Join</h1>

<p>The shuffle overhead in the repartition join can be decreased if both L and R have already been partitioned on the join key before the join operation. This can be accomplished by pre-partitioning L on the join key as log records are generated and by pre-partitioning R on the join key when it is loaded into the DFS. Then at query time, matching partitions from L and R can be directly joined</p>

<pre><code>Inits:
    - If Ri not exists in local storage then remotely retrieve Ri and store locally HRi ← build a hash table from Ri

Map phase: 
    - Input: (K: null, V: a record from a split of Li)
    - Output: join V with HRi by join key of V and join key of HRi
</code></pre>

<p>We can see directed join only store a hash table of Ri (part of R), which is small, so it is avoid run out of memory in the case of R is big or L table is skewed. The disadvantage of this approach is that R and L must be pre-partitioning.</p>

<h1>
<a id="broadcast-join" class="anchor" href="#broadcast-join" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Broadcast Join</h1>

<p>Usually, R is much smaller than L. To avoid overhead due to storing and sending both tables, we can simply <strong>broadcast</strong> only R.</p>

<pre><code>Init phase:
    - if R not exist in local storage then
        remotely retrieve R
        partition R into p chunks R1..Rp save R1..Rp to local storage

    if R &lt; a split of L then
        HR ← build a hash table from R1..Rp
    else
        HL1 ..HLp ← initialize p hash tables for L

Map phase: 
    - Input: (K: null, V : a record from an L split)
    - Output: join V with HR or HLi (if HR is null)
</code></pre>

<p>The purpose of <strong>init phase</strong> is to hope that not all partitions of R have to be loaded in memory during the join. Besides that, to optimize the memory, the smaller of R and the split of L is chosen to build the hash table. </p>

<p>Note that across map tasks, the partitions of R may be reloaded several times, since each map task runs as a separate process.</p>

<h1>
<a id="semi-join" class="anchor" href="#semi-join" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Semi Join</h1>

<p>This approach for the situation that R is large but many records in R may not be actually referenced by any records in table L. If we use <strong>broadcast join</strong>, there will be a large portion of the records in R that are shipped across the network (via the DFS) and loaded in the hash table are not used by the join. For a summary, we use semi Join to avoid sending the records in R over the network that will not join with L.</p>

<pre><code>Phase 1: Extract unique join keys in L to a single file L.uk (which is)

Phase 2: Use L.uk to filter referenced R records; generate a file Ri for each R split

Phase 3: Broadcast all Ri to each L split for the final join
</code></pre>

<p>Although semi-join avoids sending the records in R over the network that will not join with L, it does this at the cost of an extra scan of L.</p>

<h1>
<a id="per-split-semi-join" class="anchor" href="#per-split-semi-join" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Per-Split Semi-Join</h1>

<p>One problem with semi-join is that not every record in the filtered version of R will join with a particular split Li of L. The per-split semi-join is designed to address this problem.</p>

<pre><code>Phase 1: Extract unique join keys for each L split to Li.uk

Phase 2: Use Li.uk to filter referenced R; generate a file RLi for each Li

Phase 3: Directed join between each RLi and Li pair
</code></pre>

<p>Compared to the basic semi-join, the per-split semi-join makes the third phase even cheaper since it moves just the records in R that will join with each split of L. However, its first two phases are more involved.</p>
