LogProc
=======
In this project, I implemented different join algorithms from: 

"A Comparison of Join Algorithms for Log Processing in MapReduce" of Spyros Blanas, Jignesh M. Patel, Vuk Ercegovac, Jun Rao, Eugene J. Shekita and Yuanyuan Tian

You can find the paper online at http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~tsotras/cs260/F12/LogProc.pdf, or in [material](/material) directory of this project.

Abbreviation
=======
L: log table

R: reference talbe

Standard Repartition Join
=======
It is also the join algorithm provided in the con- tributed join package of Hadoop **(org.apache.hadoop.contrib. utils.join)**. L and R are dynamically partitioned on the join key and the corresponding pairs of partitions are joined. 

	Map phase: 
		- Each map task works on a split of either R or L, uses tagging to identify with is original table
		- Input: (K: null, V : a record from a split of either R or L)
		- Output: (join key, tagged record)

	Reduce phase:
		- Input: (K': join key, LIST V': records from R and L with join key K')
		- Buffer records from R (Br) and buffer records from L (Bl)
		- Performs a cross-product between records in set of Br and Bl.
		- Output: (null, r*l) which r*l is joined record

Potential problem: When the key cardinality is small or when the data is highly skewed, all the records for a given join key may not fit in memory (Br + Bl, mostly Bl).

Improved Repartition Join
=======
To fix the buffering problem of the standard repartition join which is Bl too large.

	Map phase: 
		- Each map task works on a split of either R or L, uses tagging to identify with is original table
		- Input: (K: null, V : a record from a split of either R or L)
		- Output: (composite_key, tagged record) with composite_key = (join key, tag)

	Partiion phase: 
		- Input: composite_key K
		- Output: partition of K which is hashcode(K.join_key) % num of reducers

	Grouping phase: 
		- Input: composite_key K1 and K2
		- Output: group K1 and K2 if (K1.join_key == K2.join_key)

	Secondary sort phase:
		- Input: composite_key K1 and K2
		- Output: K1 < K2 (if K1.tag == ref && K2.tag == log)

	Reduce phase:
		- Input: Kâ€²: a composite key with the join key and the tag, LIST V': records for K', first from R, then L
		- Buffer records from R (Br) - **only R**
		- Performs a cross-product between records in set of R and L.
		- Output: (null, r*l) with r*l is joined record

Potential problem: Both versions (Standard Repartition Join and Improved Repartition Join) include two major sources of overhead that can hurt performance. In particular, both L and R have to be sorted and sent over the network during the shuffle phase of MapReduce
