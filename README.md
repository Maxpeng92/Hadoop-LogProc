LogProc
=======
In this project, I implemented different join algorithms from : 

A Comparison of Join Algorithms for Log Processing in MapReduce of Spyros Blanas, Jignesh M. Patel, Vuk Ercegovac, Jun Rao, Eugene J. Shekita and Yuanyuan Tian

You can find the paper online at http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~tsotras/cs260/F12/LogProc.pdf, or in /material directory of this project.

For the simplicity, all the codes are implemented for the one-to-one join (it's easy to change to one-to-many or many-to-many join)
